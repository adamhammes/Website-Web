				<p>
					I have seven years of experience and training in teaching since the beginning of my career. I am convinced that an engaged student will learn and retain the material of a  class more efficiently. During the pandemic crisis I realized that this component had become even more important in my teaching style, and that it was also one of my responsibilities to create an environment in which students want to be involved in.

				<p>
					You will find a list of the present classes that I taught or the past classes that I taught.
